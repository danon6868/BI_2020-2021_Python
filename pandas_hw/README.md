# Pandas homework

Here the task was to make stacked bar plot on nucleotide frequency data and to perform EDA of any dataset. 

## Description

Code, graphs and detailed analysis are located in **medical_cost.ipynb** jupyter notebook.

I used this [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance). Besides EDA I also built several linear models to predict amount of health insurance and also implemented *propensity score* to deal with confoundness.
